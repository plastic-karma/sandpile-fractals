# sandpile-fractals
Creating fractals with sandpiles

Inspired by [a video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MtEUErz7Gg&t=824s) about sandpiles and fractals, I wrote a little python program to generate these.

You can simply run ``sandpile_fractal.py`` in the command line and it will generate a 20k sandpile. In the samples folder are json documents for larger inputs, to not having them regenerate everytime. They can be used together with ``sandpile_deserializer.py``.
